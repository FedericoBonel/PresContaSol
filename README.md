# SolPresControl
## _The java purist enterprise application_

Ever found your self having to keep track of multiple accountants presentations? 
It's a tedious task I know, but by using SolPresControl you would only need to login, create the solicitation for the documents, and wait for your registered accountants to turn them in and mark them as such. No hassle in between, the app keeps track of all the necessary roles and their corresponding permitions:

- The administrators
- The general supervisors
- The supervisors of every accountant
- The accountants

## Requirements 

* Maven 3.8.4
* JDK 17
